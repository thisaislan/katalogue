# Katalogue

Imagine you are starting on a new Unity project, you don't know anything about that project and you just need to create a simple settings menu. First you need to know if there is a yellow button prefab to open the settings menu or if you need to create a new one.

You will, of course, check the prefabs folder to see if there are any "MenuSettingsButton" or something like this. Then, on failure, you'll try to check if one of the 30 different buttons is yellow.

And then, if all else fails (including asking for help :worried:), you can see if there is something in this project to help you to create a your new yellow button.

Wouldn't it be awesome if there was `a tool to help you create some catalogs` with all types of prefabs in your project and help you know which prefabs already exist, `with image, description and an easy way to instantiate that prefab`?

Then meet the Katalogue :heart_eyes:

## How it works

After installing, go to the new folder called `Katalogue` and you can create your first Katalogue file there, right click `Create/Katalogue/New Katalogue`

<br>

Put a nice name and add every prefab you want

<br>

And done! :grin: You just created your first Katalogue!

Now let's instantiate some new game objects in the scene using your newly created Katalogue. To do that open the main Katalogue window in `Tools/Katalogue/Open Katalogue window`

![Katalogue main window](https://github.com/thisaislan/just-images/raw/main/images/katalogue/katalogue_main_window.png)

<br>

In that window you can see all Katalogues files inside of the Katalogue folder :smiley:.

In addition, you can create menu items to help you instantiate new game objects by right-clicking the hierarchy window. To do this just go to `Tools/Katalogue/Generate menus items`, after that a new menu item will be created for each Katalogue file inside the Katalogue folder

<br>

By clicking on this menu, a smaller version of the Katalogue window will open and allow you to create a game object from this Katalogue file

<br>

Okay, let's say now you just want to create a catalog from an entire folder, easy! :smirk:. Just to create a `Katalogue Folder` by right clicking `Create/Katalogue/New Katalogue Folder`,select the desired folder and that's it!

> **_Tip_**: You can see tips about the tool in the Katalogue files by clicking in the first label :wink:
